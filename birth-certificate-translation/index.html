			<h2>I live outside the UK. Will my certificate translation be accepted for use outside the UK?</h2>
            <p>For overseas customers, who wants to authenticate the translated certificate produced in the UK, we offer Apostille service & Legalisation service, we attach an apostille to the reverse of the certificate. Lentrax always recommends the authentication before whomever our client is presenting the certificate to, in order to identify if the apostille stamp is needed or not?</p><p>The Apostille Certificate is generally asked by foreign authorities and organisations to use the certificate for official purpose even outside the UK. This says that you must have a correctly legalized certificate with you before you travel and within a specific time.</p>
			<p>Foreign authorities always require legalization before accepting a UK certificate for official purposes outside the UK. The UK Apostille Certificate is always acceptable in foreign countries but it requires further legalisation. Use Lentrax legalization service for the Middle East, UAE Legalisation Service, Qatar Legalisation Service or Kuwait Legalisation Service or Egypt Legalisation Service.</p>
			
			<p>Lentrax will help you obtain a Birth, Death or Marriage certificate as quickly and as easily as possible.<br>•	Births Deaths Marriages<br>•	UK Official Services to order a certificate online<br></p>
			
			<p>Births, Deaths and Marriages are usually grouped as BD&M. The official registration of births, deaths and marriages started in the United Kingdom on 1st July 1837, soon after Queen Victoria became the authority. Civil Registration of Births and Deaths in England and Wales started in September 1837 including English and Welsh Marriage registration as well; the whole process began in Scotland in 1855. For Ireland, it began in 1864, with Marriages registered 19 years prior in 1845.</p><p>The services of birth, death and marriage before these dates were considered as religious Services. Parish records, recorded baptisms, marriages and burials that happened at the parish church. Other religious services would be non-conformist entries, Jewish Services & Roman Catholic registers.</p><p>Talking about the latest trend, marriage is registered at the time of the event. The birth of a child must be registered within 42 days in England & Wales whereas for Scotland the timespan is 21 days. Similarly, a death must be registered within 5 days in England and Wales. These events can only be registered at a Registry office. You only have to specify the district of the event where it occurred and it can be registered at any office.</p>

            <p style="width:100%!important;">The certificate that confirms the signature and seal is genuine is known as Apostille and its obtaining process is called Legalisation.  Foreign authorities usually required Legalization before they allow the use of a UK document for official use in their country. Only the following countries accept the UK Apostille Certificates without further legalisation - Apostille Countries.</p><p>•	Name at birth</p><p>•	Date of birth</p><p>•	Time of birth</p><p>•	Sex</p><p>•	NHS number for the UK</p><p>•	Legal parent(s)</p>
			
			<p style="width:100%!important;">Certified Copy of Birth certificates is available in countries within the UK of Great Britain including England, Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales. If the birth, death, marriage or any event took place in these countries, then a certificate is available.</p>
			<p style="width:100%!important;">The full certified copy of duplicate birth certificates is also known as unabridged certificates. The included details are a full name at birth, date of birth, place of birth and details of the parents. The abridged certificate or short birth certificate usually issued at birth does not have the parents' details, and it does not help in genealogist for research purposes.</p>
			<p style="width:100%!important;">All the events (birth, marriages and deaths) in England and Wales are required to register by law. According to the law that came into effect on July 1st, 1837 and according to the "Births and Deaths Act 1874", parents are under obligation to report the birth at the time of the event, late or non-registration is penalised and fined.</p>
			<p style="width:100%!important;">Since 1969, they only record the surname and note the gender as male or female and the format was a portrait. Prior to 1969, the surname was not registered, and the gender was termed as boy or girl, and the format was a landscape.</p>
			<p style="width:100%!important;">A birth certificate is not always accepted as proof of identity for the UK nationals. It is unlawful to mimic someone else by a birth certificate and is defined as identity fraud in law. Such certificates are usually obtained for family history, for adjustment processes, genealogy, and passport applications.</p>

			<p style="width:100%!important;"> A document issued by government officials or registrar that has the date, location and cause of death. Before the issuance of a death certificate, the related authorities require a certificate from a physician to validate the cause of death and the identity of the person. When it is uncertain that how did the person die (because their body is being assisted by life support), sometimes a neurologist is called in to verify brain death and to complete the formal documentation.</p>
			<p>The registration of death began in 1837 in the UK. The death certificate keeps the record when and where the person died, his name and surname, gender, date of birth, occupation, address, cause of death, it also contains the information of the person who reported the death. Started in 1874, a doctor's certificate was required for the issuance of a death certificate. The birth registration started in 1927 while the death cause was listed after 1960.</p><p>Lentrax Certificate translation services will assist you in issuance, translation and other requirements of Death & other certificates whether the certificates are government or private.</p>
